Images will be temporarily stored here until they are uploaded to Cloudinary, 
after which they will be deleted. The useTempFile property, although convenient, 
overcomplicates the cleanup process. In the sense that if someone interacts with 
our API with the incorrect req.file name, I would have to perform some acrobatics 
to ensure that it's cleaned up. So, this folder makes that process a bit easier!

It will also be used to hold screenshots for the README.md
